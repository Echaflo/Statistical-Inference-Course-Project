# Synopsis

##### This report is part of Statistical Inference course from Johns Hopkins University (Coursera).

### It consists of two parts:

 1. A simulation exercise.

    * will compare the exponential distribution in R with the Central Limit Theorem.

 2. Basic inferential data analysis.

    * I will analyze (very basically) the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.


### Part 1 : Simulation exercise with exponentials

##### Generate 175 random values from a normal distribution of mean 3 and standard deviation 2 (uses seed 113) 
```{r,echo = TRUE}
options(width=80)
set.seed(113) 
datos<-rnorm(175,3,2)
head(datos)
```
##### Now let's see two important data such as the mean and variance of the data 
```{r,echo = TRUE}
mean(datos)
var(datos)
```
##### Now let's see the histogram reflecting the distribution of the information 
```{r,echo = TRUE}
 hist(datos)
```

##### Relative frequencies are represented and it is possible to make a comparison with the theoretical density function. This comparison is done by executing the following code below. 
```{r,echo = TRUE}
 hist(datos, freq=FALSE)
 curve(dnorm(x,3,2),add=TRUE)
```

##### From the above we can see how the sample data are distributed against the density they show, so we see the central limit theorem. 

### Part 2 : Basic inferential data analysis with ToothGrowth dataset


#### ToothGrowth: The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs

##### Description

###### The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose
###### levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).


#### Mission

0. Load library's

1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses

2. Provide a basic summary of the data.

3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by Supplement and Dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if thereâ€™s other approaches worth considering)

4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.


##### Load library's

```{r,echo = TRUE}
library(data.table)
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
```




##### Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses

```{r,echo = TRUE}
# The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs
data(ToothGrowth)
toothGrowth <- data.table(ToothGrowth) 
setnames(toothGrowth, c('len','supp','dose'),c('Length','Supplement','Dose'))
toothGrowth$Dose <- as.factor(toothGrowth$Dose)
```
##### As we see, there are 60 observations with 3 variables in this data. Here is a brief explanation of the variables: len denotes the length of the growth, supp represents the delivery (supplement) type (either VC or OJ), and dose denotes the dose in milligrams/day. We change the names of the variables to Length, Supplement, and Dose, respectively.


#### Basic Summary of the data

```{r,echo = TRUE}
summary(toothGrowth)
head(toothGrowth)
```

```{r,echo = TRUE}
g<-ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=supp, y=len, color=supp)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_grid(facets = ~ dose) + labs(title="Tooth growth by supplement type and dose(mg)" , y = "length", x = "Supplement")
g
```
```{r,echo = TRUE}

```
```{r,echo = TRUE}

```
```{r,echo = TRUE}

```
```{r,echo = TRUE}

```
```{r,echo = TRUE}

```
```{r,echo = TRUE}

```
```{r,echo = TRUE}

```
```{r,echo = TRUE}
