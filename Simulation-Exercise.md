# Synopsis

##### This report is part of Statistical Inference course from Johns Hopkins University (Coursera).

### It consists of two parts:

 1. A simulation exercise.

    * will compare the exponential distribution in R with the Central Limit Theorem.

 2. Basic inferential data analysis.

    * I will analyze (very basically) the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.


### Part 1 : Simulation exercise with exponentials

##### Generate 175 random values from a normal distribution of mean 3 and standard deviation 2 (uses seed 113) 

```r
options(width=80)
set.seed(113) 
datos<-rnorm(175,3,2)
head(datos)
```

```
## [1]  3.2667090  5.7504432  4.4974301  0.4122990  1.8824584 -0.4648985
```
##### Now let's see two important data such as the mean and variance of the data 

```r
mean(datos)
```

```
## [1] 2.892319
```

```r
var(datos)
```

```
## [1] 4.042107
```
##### Now let's see the histogram reflecting the distribution of the information 

```r
 hist(datos)
```

##### Relative frequencies are represented and it is possible to make a comparison with the theoretical density function. This comparison is done by executing the following code below. 

```r
 hist(datos, freq=FALSE)
 curve(dnorm(x,3,2),add=TRUE)
```

##### From the above we can see how the sample data are distributed against the density they show, so we see the central limit theorem. 

### Part 2 : Basic inferential data analysis with ToothGrowth dataset


#### ToothGrowth: The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs

##### Description

###### The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose
###### levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).


#### Mission

0. Load library's

1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses

2. Provide a basic summary of the data.

3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by Supplement and Dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if thereâ€™s other approaches worth considering)

4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.


##### Load library's


```r
library(data.table)
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
```




##### Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses


```r
# The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs
data(ToothGrowth)
toothGrowth <- data.table(ToothGrowth) 
setnames(toothGrowth, c('len','supp','dose'),c('Length','Supplement','Dose'))
toothGrowth$Dose <- as.factor(toothGrowth$Dose)
```
##### As we see, there are 60 observations with 3 variables in this data. Here is a brief explanation of the variables: len denotes the length of the growth, supp represents the delivery (supplement) type (either VC or OJ), and dose denotes the dose in milligrams/day. We change the names of the variables to Length, Supplement, and Dose, respectively.


#### Basic Summary of the data


```r
summary(toothGrowth)
```

```
##      Length      Supplement  Dose   
##  Min.   : 4.20   OJ:30      0.5:20  
##  1st Qu.:13.07   VC:30      1  :20  
##  Median :19.25              2  :20  
##  Mean   :18.81                      
##  3rd Qu.:25.27                      
##  Max.   :33.90
```

```r
head(toothGrowth)
```

```
##    Length Supplement Dose
## 1:    4.2         VC  0.5
## 2:   11.5         VC  0.5
## 3:    7.3         VC  0.5
## 4:    5.8         VC  0.5
## 5:    6.4         VC  0.5
## 6:   10.0         VC  0.5
```


```r
g<-ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=supp, y=len, color=supp)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_grid(facets = ~ dose) + labs(title="Tooth growth by supplement type and dose(mg)" , y = "length", x = "Supplement")
g
```
